## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Hashnode Integration

This template comes with built-in integration for your Hashnode blog and newsletter. All you need is three keys from your Hashnode account to get started.

### What's Included
- **Blog Posts**: Automatically displays your Hashnode blog posts
- **Newsletter**: Lets visitors subscribe to your Hashnode newsletter
- **Error Handling**: Friendly error messages if something goes wrong
- **Loading States**: Nice loading animations while content is being fetched

### Quick Setup

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:
```env
# .env.local
PUBLIC_HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_ID=your_publication_id
PUBLIC_HASHNODE_HOST=your_blog_url    # e.g., "johndoe.hashnode.dev"
HASHNODE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
```

2. Get your keys from Hashnode:
   - Log into your Hashnode account
   - Go to Account Settings → Developer Settings
   - Copy your Publication ID and Access Token
   - For the Host, use your Hashnode blog URL without 'https://' (e.g., "johndoe.hashnode.dev")
   - Paste them into the `.env.local` file

That's it! Your blog posts and newsletter will now work automatically. No coding required.

> **Note**: Keep your Access Token private - don't share it or commit it to public repositories.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
